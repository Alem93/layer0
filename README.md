# My notes

## What you intended to accomplish in this assessment
Improve the performance of the website Lush by using layer0 plugin

## What youâ€™d do as next steps if you had more time
I would delve more in the documentation, specially about caching and get as much as possible of it.
I used some selectors to cache some images for the PDP and I think that I could do it better and cache more PDP content

## Any feedback you may have for Layer0 regarding the process.
The tutorial and the walkthrough was very good maybe it can be improved the way some concepts are presented and exemplify a bit more some use cases.
